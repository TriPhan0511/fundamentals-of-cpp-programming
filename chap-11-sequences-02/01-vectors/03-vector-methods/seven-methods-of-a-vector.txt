Vectors support a number of methods, but we will focus on seven of them:

• push_back—inserts a new element onto the back of a vector

• pop_back—removes the last element from a vector

• operator[]—provides access to the value stored at a given index within the vector

• at—provides bounds-checking access to the value stored at a given position within the vector

• size—returns the number of values currently stored in the vector

• empty—returns true if the vector contains no elements; returns false if the vector contains one or
    more elements

• clear—makes the vector empty.
