A polymorphic method in C++ requires four key ingredients:

    1. The method must appear in a class that is part of an inheritance hierarchy.
    2. The method must declared virtual in the base class at the top of the
       hierarchy.
    3. Derived classes override the behavior of the inherited virtual methods as
       needed.
    4. Clients must invoke the method via a pointer (or reference) to an object, not
       directly through the object itself.
