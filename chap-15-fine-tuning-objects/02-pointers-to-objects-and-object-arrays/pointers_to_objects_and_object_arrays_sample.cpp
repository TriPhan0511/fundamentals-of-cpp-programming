/*
Here, acct_ptr is a local variable, so it occupies space on the stack. 
It represents a simple address, essentially a number. The space for the acct_ptr variable 
is automatically deallocated when faulty_func completes. The problem is acct_ptr points to 
memory that was allocated with new, and this memory is not freed up within the function. 
The pointer acct_ptr is the only way to get to that memory, so when the function is finished, 
that memory is lost for the life of the program. The condition is known as a memory leak. 
If the program runs to completion quickly, the leak may go undetected. In a longer 
running program such as a web server, memory leaks can cause the program to crash after 
a period of time. The problem arises when code that leaks memory is executed repeatedly 
and eventually all of available memory becomes used up.

//     p->y = -0.5;
